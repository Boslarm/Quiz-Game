# Coding Quiz Game

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding and implimentation of JavaScript in regards to HTML. That is, using JavaScript logic and variables to create an interactive HTML. This demonstration produces an interactive HTML out of a stactic HTML apart from the JavaScript.

Additionaly, and on a more personal note, I litertally could not have completed this assignment without the help from my tutor Byron Brown, my TA Paul Cwik, and my study group. Without their input on the logic and helping me find solutions and offer ideas, I would not have a working Quiz.
